Somebody in the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/" target="_blank">tutorial documentation in Jekyllrb.com</a> wrote, You can use any html template and make it your website theme. This is true because I finally finish the conversion.

  I received Bachelor of English Literature title from Universitas Negeri Padang in 2007. I am currently working as marketing support in Insurance Company.

<p class="sm-my1">
  I love to read. In digital world nowadays, I feel very greatfull that I can read whatever I want. There is a saying: If you read then you will write. It is true.
</p>
<p class="sm-my1">
  I write about my thoughts and share my experience in several blogs. I made friends and also learning how to earn pennies from what I wrote.
</p>
<p class="sm-my1">
  The new experience, earning dollars from my stories, made me learn more about website. So I learn about HTML, CSS, and Javascript (3 Codes that usually used in web developing) at HTMLDog.com. I use blogger.com, wordpress.com and self-hosted wordpress cms to create website. Now I learn and use Github Page and AMP Framework.
</p>
<p class="sm-my1">
  Please if you had any suggestion of implementation with this Github Pages, contact me through <a href="https://facebook.com/RealKandraID" target="_blank">facebook</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/kandra.id" target="_blank">instagram</a> since I still cannot configure any contact code using AMP Framework in this website.
