<a href="{{ site.url }}">This website</a> is build in <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github Page</a> as a personal project to learn developing website using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a> as static site generator and <a href="https://amp.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accelerated mobile page (AMP)</a> frameworks from Google.

  I am using sub domain of my primary blog to do this solo project. The content on old.pencaricerah.com was duplicate from the main website pencaricerah.com. Why I used <strong>old</strong> for the sub-domain? The reason is simple. Just to mark that the content had published on the primary address. This is the simple thing to do because I hate using Lorem Ipsum Dolores Sinamet thing over and over again. Plus, may be, the sub-domain had more fortune than the primary one. Who knows?

  I love to read. In digital world nowadays, I feel very greatfull that I can read whatever I want. There is a saying: If you read then you will write. It is true.

  I write about my thoughts and share my experience in several blogs. I made friends and also learning how to earn pennies from what I wrote.
</p>
<p class="sm-my1">
  The new experience, earning dollars from my stories, made me learn more about website. So I learn about HTML, CSS, and Javascript (3 Codes that usually used in web developing) at HTMLDog.com. I use blogger.com, wordpress.com and self-hosted wordpress cms to create website. Now I learn and use Github Page and AMP Framework.
</p>
<p class="sm-my1">
  Please if you had any suggestion of implementation with this Github Pages, contact me through <a href="https://facebook.com/RealKandraID" target="_blank">facebook</a> or <a href="https://instagram.com/kandra.id" target="_blank">instagram</a> since I still cannot configure any contact code using AMP Framework in this website.
